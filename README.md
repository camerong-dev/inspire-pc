### **Agile Methodology**

This project was made using some agile methodologies, but a more traditional method.  I used pen and paper to write out my to do list and any other issues which might have cropped up during the development process.  Unfortunately this wasn't documented on a site like the GitHub project board or Jira etc so is not possible to bring onto here.  I have put into the same original to do task into the [project board](https://github.com/users/camerong-dev/projects/4) as an indication of what I had on paper.

### **Wireframes**

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq.  These were initial ideas of the site structure and layout.

### **Database**

I used [Lucid chart](https://lucidchart.com/pages/) to create a data flow diagram showing what an authorized and non-authorized user had access to throughout the site. I have also shown below my custom model and the user model which was used within this project.

### **Color Scheme**

All colours used throughout are listed above.  I found the blue color on [colormind](https://www.colormind.io) and liked the vibrancy it provided.  I then used a basic light grey and white background to go with the blue, to leave me with a clean and modern looking site.
